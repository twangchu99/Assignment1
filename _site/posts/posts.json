It will be interesting to see how wages have been increasing in these states across the decades as well as in comparison to each other.\n\n\n\n Using the nurses dataset, I wanted to understand how salary for nurses vary across different geographical regions in the U.S. In the visualization below, we can observe that California has the highest annual salary followed by other States such as Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Texas and Colorado. Most states on the East Coast have relatovely lower annual average salaries for Registered Nurses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
